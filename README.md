Canned challenge problems are sufficient practice for brand-new Python developers. But if you're an intermediate programmer looking to bring a novel idea to life, you require more nuanced, in-depth instruction and practice. In this course, instructor Barron Stone helps you learn Python the hands-on way, showing you what it takes to bring a Python project to the finish line. He walks you step by step through his entire development process for a single personal Python project, from initial ideation to building the final installer for distribution. As you follow along, you can observe the thought process that Barron follows, giving you a path to follow to create your own projects.
